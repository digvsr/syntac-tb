# Syntac Edu Timetable

A simple tool to manage school timetables.

## Functionalities
- **Generate Timetables:** Pick a grade (1-10) and section (A or B) to see a class schedule.
- **Export All Schedules:** Download an HTML file with timetables for all classes (1th-A to 10th-B).
- **Update with Unavailable Teachers:** Enter teacher IDs (e.g., "T001,T002") to reassign slots if teachers aren’t available.
- **Options Menu:** Choose to regenerate tables, shuffle teachers, or adjust classes (some features TBD).

## Files
- `app.py`: Runs the backend and serves the app.
- `App.js`: Powers the interactive frontend.
- `App.css`: Styles the interface.
